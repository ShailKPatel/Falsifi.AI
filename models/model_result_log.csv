1,SiameseCNN,ContrastiveLoss,CNN(3 conv + 2 fc),ContrastiveLoss,Two-branch CNN extracts embeddings and contrastive loss enforces distance for signature verification,0.4181,0.5732,0.4471,0.7986,0.179298,Basic Siamese CNN baseline chosen to establish reference performance and enable comparison with more complex models
2,TripletCNN,TripletPipeline,CNN(3 conv + 2 fc),TripletMarginLoss,Anchor-positive-negative CNN embedding framework enforcing relative distances for signature verification,0.7324,0.6951,0.7128,0.6789,0.152367,Chosen to model relative similarity instead of absolute distance and providing a stronger baseline than Siamese
3,SigNet+Augmentation,SiameseCNN with Data Augmentation,CNN(3 conv + 2 fc),ContrastiveLoss,Two-branch CNN with random rotation & elastic distortion & Gaussian noise,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.000000,Augmented Siamese CNN designed to enhance robustness on limited data by adding realistic handwriting variations
4,ResNet18Siamese,TransferLearning Siamese,ResNet18 pretrained + FC(128),ContrastiveLoss,Siamese with ResNet18 backbone frozen then fine tuned with ImageNet normalization and light affine plus flip augmentation producing 128D L2 embeddings,0.4309,0.4339,0.4227,0.4457,0.000006,Leverages transfer learning for richer features on small CEDAR and two stage training improves stability and performance
